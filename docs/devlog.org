Plot didn't impact the Generic Entity yet
Need to work on the game map

Stepping back from the map again
Might be worthwhile to look into movement a little more
Instead of keyboard movement, mouse movement might make sense
So lets look into that

Added some other entities to the screen and adjusted animations
to handle different animation lenghts

Going to just do a branch per day at the moment instead of per topic
I do poorly at the branch per topic process

1. I need a map to put obstacles on
   1. A big grid is easy to implement
   2. Alternatively, obstacles can exist on the same gridless plane as
      entities.   A map could be a large background image and a list
      of obstacles.  
2. Map will implement A* from any arbitrary pixel coordinates to any
   arbitrary pizel coordinates.
   1. This means the map will need to know the starting point, size,
      and anchor for the moving entity and each possible obstacle
3. Obstacles on map stop movement
   1. Since entities move towards a target, and move until they reach
      that target, this is causing an issue.
   2. When an object is encountered we need to do a few things
      1. Stop moving.
	 * Set the target_x and target_y to the position reached just
	   before colliding with the object
      2. Check for what we collided with
	 * Some obstacles may need special handling
	 * Damage
	 * Activate special features
	 * AI reactions
	 * Trigger game effects
